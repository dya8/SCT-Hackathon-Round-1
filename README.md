# Find the Best Delivery Route


This repo involves optimizing the delivery route for a vehicle starting from the depot of an eCommerce organization (like Walmart) to deliver packages to customer locations. Here's a reframed description of the process of finding the best route:

Origin Point Identification: The delivery process begins at the depot, which serves as the starting point for the vehicle's journey.

Customer Location Coverage: The vehicle is tasked with reaching every customer location where an order has been placed, ensuring efficient delivery of packages.

Route Optimization: The goal is to devise the most efficient route that minimizes travel time and distance while ensuring timely delivery to each customer location.

Single Visit Constraint: Each customer location is visited only once to deliver the package. This constraint ensures that the vehicle optimally utilizes its resources and time.

Return Journey Planning: Once all customer deliveries are completed, the vehicle returns to the depot from the last customer delivery location, completing the delivery cycle.

Efficiency Maximization: The objective is to maximize overall delivery efficiency by strategically planning the sequence of customer visits and the return journey to the depot.

Dynamic Routing Considerations: Factors such as traffic conditions, road closures, and real-time order updates may necessitate dynamic adjustments to the planned route to adapt to changing circumstances and optimize delivery efficiency furth
